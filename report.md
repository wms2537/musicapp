  Audio Processing Algorithms

  1. Time Stretching: PSOLA (Pitch Synchronous Overlap-Add)

  Algorithm Overview

  PSOLA is a time-domain audio processing technique that allows modification of audio duration while preserving pitch characteristics. It works by analyzing audio in overlapping frames and reconstructing the output at different temporal
  rates.

  Mathematical Foundation

  The core principle involves:
  - Frame Size (N): Fixed at 512 samples to preserve frequency content
  - Analysis Hop (Ha): Variable input advance = 128 × speed_factor
  - Synthesis Hop (Hs): Fixed output advance = 128 samples
  - Speed Ratio: Ha/Hs determines the time stretching factor

  Implementation Details

  // PSOLA Parameters
  int frame_size = 512;           // Analysis frame size
  int synthesis_hop = 128;        // Output hop size (25% of frame)
  int analysis_hop = (int)(synthesis_hop * speed_factor); // Input hop size

  // Normalized Hann Window
  for (int i = 0; i < frame_size; i++) {
      float window_val = 0.5f * (1.0f - cosf(2.0f * M_PI * i / (frame_size - 1)));
      // Normalize for perfect reconstruction
      psola_window[i] = window_val / overlap_sum;
  }

  Window Normalization

  Critical for artifact-free reconstruction:
  // Calculate overlap sum for normalization
  for (int j = -2; j <= 2; j++) {
      int offset = j * synthesis_hop;
      if (i + offset >= 0 && i + offset < frame_size) {
          overlap_sum += hann_window(i + offset);
      }
  }

  Speed-Specific Parameters

  - 0.5x Speed: analysis_hop = 64, synthesis_hop = 128 → Ratio = 0.5
  - 1.5x Speed: analysis_hop = 192, synthesis_hop = 128 → Ratio = 1.5
  - 2.0x Speed: analysis_hop = 256, synthesis_hop = 128 → Ratio = 2.0

  Advantages

  - Pitch Preservation: Frequency content unchanged
  - Phase Continuity: Smooth transitions for continuous signals
  - Computational Efficiency: Time-domain processing (no FFT required)

  Limitations

  - Transient Smearing: Sharp attacks may be softened
  - Overlap Artifacts: Potential phase cancellation in complex signals
  - Memory Usage: Requires buffering for overlap regions

  2. Equalizer: FIR Filter Implementation

  Filter Design Philosophy

  The equalizer uses Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters for frequency shaping, chosen for:
  - Linear Phase Response: No phase distortion
  - Stability: Always stable (no feedback)
  - Precise Control: Exact frequency response specification

  Filter Coefficients

  Bass Boost Filter (< 250Hz emphasis):
  static double bass_boost_coeffs[32] = {
      -0.0020, -0.0025, -0.0030, -0.0025, 0.0000, 0.0050, 0.0120, 0.0200,
       0.0280,  0.0350,  0.0400,  0.0420, 0.0400, 0.0350, 0.0280, 0.0200,
       0.0200,  0.0280,  0.0350,  0.0400, 0.0420, 0.0400, 0.0350, 0.0280,
       0.0200,  0.0120,  0.0050,  0.0000, -0.0025, -0.0030, -0.0025, -0.0020
  };

       0.0500, -0.0550,  0.0600, -0.0650,  0.0700, -0.0750,  0.0800,  0.4000,
       0.4000,  0.0800, -0.0750,  0.0700, -0.0650,  0.0600, -0.0550,  0.0500,
      -0.0450,  0.0400, -0.0350,  0.0300, -0.0250,  0.0200, -0.0150,  0.0100
  };

  static double vocal_enhance_coeffs[32] = {
      -0.0100, -0.0080, -0.0060, -0.0040, -0.0020,  0.0000,  0.0020,  0.0040,
       0.0060,  0.0080,  0.0100,  0.0150,  0.0250,  0.0400,  0.0600,  0.0800,
       0.0800,  0.0600,  0.0400,  0.0250,  0.0150,  0.0100,  0.0080,  0.0060,
       0.0040,  0.0020,  0.0000, -0.0020, -0.0040, -0.0060, -0.0080, -0.0100
  };

  Filter Implementation

  void apply_fir_filter(short* input, short* output, int length, equalizer_mode_t mode) {
      double* coeffs = get_filter_coeffs(mode);
      double gain = get_filter_gain(mode);
      double mix_ratio = get_mix_ratio(mode);

      for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
          // Convolution operation
          double filtered_sample = 0.0;
          for (int j = 0; j < FIR_TAP_NUM; j++) {
              int index = (delay_index - j + FIR_TAP_NUM) % FIR_TAP_NUM;
              filtered_sample += coeffs[j] * delay_buffer[index];
          }

          // Apply gain and mix with original
          filtered_sample *= gain;
          double mixed_sample = filtered_sample * mix_ratio + input[i] * (1.0 - mix_ratio);

          // Clamp to prevent overflow
          output[i] = (short)clamp(mixed_sample, -32768, 32767);
      }
  }

  Gain and Mixing Strategy

  - Gain Compensation:
    - Bass: 2.0x gain for low-frequency boost
    - Treble: 1.5x gain for high-frequency enhancement
    - Vocal: 1.8x gain for mid-range clarity
  - Wet/Dry Mixing:
    - 70% processed + 30% original for natural sound
    - 60% processed + 40% original for vocal mode

  3. Audio File Processing: WAV Format Support

  WAV Header Parsing

  struct WAV_HEADER {
      char chunk_id[4];           // "RIFF"
      uint32_t chunk_size;        // File size - 8
      char format[4];             // "WAVE"
      char sub_chunk1_id[4];      // "fmt "
      uint32_t sub_chunk1_size;   // 16 for PCM
      uint16_t audio_format;      // 1 = PCM
      uint16_t num_channels;      // 1 = Mono, 2 = Stereo
      uint32_t sample_rate;       // 8000, 44100, etc.
      uint32_t byte_rate;         // SampleRate * NumChannels * BitsPerSample/8
      uint16_t block_align;       // NumChannels * BitsPerSample/8
      uint16_t bits_per_sample;   // 8, 16, 24, 32
      char sub_chunk2_id[4];      // "data"
      uint32_t sub_chunk2_size;   // NumSamples * NumChannels * BitsPerSample/8
  };

  Robust Data Chunk Detection

  // Search for data chunk (handles non-standard WAV files)
  while (fread(chunk_id, 1, 4, fp) == 4) {
      fread(&chunk_size, 1, 4, fp);

      if (strncmp(chunk_id, "data", 4) == 0) {
          data_chunk_offset = ftell(fp);
          break;
      } else {
          fseek(fp, chunk_size, SEEK_CUR); // Skip unknown chunk
      }
  }

  static short audio_buffer[AUDIO_BUFFER_SIZE];
  static short processed_buffer[AUDIO_BUFFER_SIZE];
  static float overlap_buffer[4096] = {0};  // PSOLA state preservation

  Buffer Size Considerations

  - Input Buffer: 4096 samples (optimized for ALSA period size)

  snd_pcm_t *pcm_handle;
  snd_pcm_hw_params_t *hw_params;

  // Configure hardware parameters
  snd_pcm_hw_params_set_access(pcm_handle, hw_params, SND_PCM_ACCESS_RW_INTERLEAVED);
  snd_pcm_hw_params_set_format(pcm_handle, hw_params, SND_PCM_FORMAT_S16_LE);
  snd_pcm_hw_params_set_channels(pcm_handle, hw_params, wav_header.num_channels);

  snd_mixer_t *mixer_handle;
  snd_mixer_elem_t *mixer_elem;
  snd_mixer_selem_set_playback_volume_all(mixer_elem, volume_levels[current_level]);

  3. Real-Time Processing Pipeline

  Main Processing Loop

  while (current_state == PLAYING) {
      // 1. Read audio data
      bytes_read = fread(audio_buffer, 1, AUDIO_BUFFER_SIZE, fp);

      // 2. Apply time stretching
      apply_time_stretch(audio_buffer, time_stretched_buffer,
                        bytes_read, &stretched_length, speed_factor);

      // 3. Apply equalizer
      apply_fir_filter(time_stretched_buffer, processed_buffer,
                      stretched_length, current_eq_mode);

      // 4. Output to ALSA
      snd_pcm_writei(pcm_handle, processed_buffer, stretched_length / block_align);

      // 5. Handle user input (non-blocking)
      handle_user_input();
  }

  4. State Management

  Playback State Machine

  typedef enum {
      STOPPED,    // No audio playing
      PLAYING,    // Active playback
      PAUSED      // Playback suspended
  } playback_state_t;

  typedef enum {
      SPEED_0_5X = 0,  // Half speed
      SPEED_1_0X = 1,  // Normal speed
      SPEED_1_5X = 2,  // 1.5x speed
      SPEED_2_0X = 3   // Double speed
  } playback_speed_t;

  typedef enum {
      EQ_NORMAL = 0,      // No processing
      EQ_BASS_BOOST = 1,  // Bass enhancement
      EQ_TREBLE_BOOST = 2,// Treble enhancement
      EQ_VOCAL_ENHANCE = 3 // Vocal clarity
  } equalizer_mode_t;

  Static Variable Management

  void reset_audio_processing_state() {
      // Reset PSOLA state
      reset_time_stretch_static_vars();

      // Reset filter delay lines
      memset(delay_buffer_left, 0, sizeof(delay_buffer_left));
      memset(delay_buffer_right, 0, sizeof(delay_buffer_right));
      delay_index_left = delay_index_right = 0;

      // Reset file position
      current_position = 0;
  }

  ---
  Performance Considerations

  1. Computational Complexity

  PSOLA Algorithm

  - Time Complexity: O(N×M) where N = frame_size, M = number of frames
  - Space Complexity: O(N) for overlap buffers
  - Real-time Factor: ~0.1-0.3 (10-30% CPU on typical embedded ARM)

  FIR Filtering

  - Time Complexity: O(K×L) where K = filter_taps (32), L = buffer_length
  - Space Complexity: O(K) for delay lines
  - Real-time Factor: ~0.05-0.1 (5-10% CPU)

  2. Memory Optimization

  Buffer Reuse Strategy

  // Reuse buffers to minimize memory footprint
  static short primary_buffer[AUDIO_BUFFER_SIZE];
  static short secondary_buffer[AUDIO_BUFFER_SIZE];

  // Ping-pong buffering for continuous processing
  short *input_buf = primary_buffer;
  short *output_buf = secondary_buffer;

  Cache-Friendly Access Patterns

  // Process samples in sequential order for cache efficiency
  for (int i = 0; i < buffer_length; i++) {
      for (int ch = 0; ch < num_channels; ch++) {
          // Channel-interleaved processing
          process_sample(buffer[i * num_channels + ch]);
      }
  }

  3. Latency Optimization

  Buffer Size Tuning

  - Small buffers (1024 samples): Lower latency, higher CPU overhead
  - Large buffers (4096 samples): Higher latency, better efficiency
  - Chosen size (4096): Balance for embedded systems

  Processing Pipeline Overlap

  // Overlap processing with I/O for reduced latency
  while (audio_playing) {
      // Process previous buffer while reading next
      if (processing_thread_ready) {
          process_audio_async(current_buffer);
      }

      // Read next buffer
      read_next_audio_block(next_buffer);

      // Swap buffers
      swap_buffers(&current_buffer, &next_buffer);
  }

  Troubleshooting & Lessons Learned

  1. PSOLA Implementation Challenges

  Initial Problem: Discontinuous Output

  Symptom: 1kHz test tone produced "beep-beep-beep" artifacts instead of continuous tone.

  Root Cause: Incorrect hop size ratios causing gaps in output coverage.
  // WRONG: Creates gaps
  int input_hop = 128;
  int output_hop = 256;  // output_hop > input_hop for 0.5x speed

  // CORRECT: Proper overlap
  int input_hop = 64;    // Slow input advance
  int output_hop = 128;  // Normal output spacing for overlap

  Solution: Adjusted hop sizes to ensure proper overlap-add coverage.

  Window Normalization Issues

  Symptom: Volume variations and amplitude dips during time stretching.

  Root Cause: Overlapping Hann windows don't sum to unity without normalization.
  // Calculate normalization factor
  float overlap_sum = 0.0f;
  for (int j = -2; j <= 2; j++) {
      int offset = j * synthesis_hop;
      if (i + offset >= 0 && i + offset < frame_size) {
          overlap_sum += hann_window(i + offset);
      }
  }
  normalized_window[i] = hann_window[i] / overlap_sum;

  Phase Continuity for Sine Waves

  Symptom: Audible artifacts in continuous tones despite proper overlap.

  Analysis: Even with perfect reconstruction, phase misalignment between overlapping grains can create subtle discontinuities.

  Mitigation: Reduced frame size and increased overlap ratio for better continuity.

  2. FIR Filter Design Evolution

  Initial Approach: Weak Filter Response

  Problem: Original filter coefficients provided minimal audible effect.

  Solution: Redesigned filters with stronger frequency response:
  - Increased coefficient magnitudes
  - Added gain compensation (1.5x-2.0x)
  - Implemented wet/dry mixing for natural sound

  Normalization and Gain Issues

  Problem: Different EQ modes had varying output levels.

  Solution:
  - Normalized all filter coefficient sets
  - Applied mode-specific gain compensation
  - Implemented consistent mixing ratios

  3. Real-Time Performance Optimization

  Buffer Underrun Issues

  Symptom: Audio dropouts and "WARNING: Audio underrun occurred" messages.

  Diagnosis: Time stretching algorithm producing insufficient output samples.

  Solutions:
  1. Implemented proper output length calculation
  2. Added buffer size validation
  3. Optimized algorithm efficiency

  Memory Access Optimization

  Issue: Cache misses due to non-sequential memory access in multi-channel processing.

  Optimization:
  // BEFORE: Poor cache locality
  for (int ch = 0; ch < num_channels; ch++) {
      for (int i = 0; i < frame_size; i++) {
          process(buffer[ch][i]);  // Non-sequential access
      }
  }

  // AFTER: Cache-friendly
  for (int i = 0; i < frame_size; i++) {
      for (int ch = 0; ch < num_channels; ch++) {
          process(buffer[i * num_channels + ch]);  // Sequential access
      }
  }

  4. Algorithm Selection Process

  Time Stretching Algorithm Evolution

  1. Simple Sample Duplication: Fast but changes pitch
  2. Granular Synthesis: Better quality but artifacts at grain boundaries
  3. WSOLA (Waveform Similarity Overlap-Add): Good for speech, complex for music
  4. PSOLA (Pitch Synchronous Overlap-Add): Final choice - best balance of quality and complexity

  Filter Type Comparison

  - IIR Filters: Considered for efficiency but rejected due to phase distortion
  - FIR Filters: Chosen for linear phase and stability
  - FFT-based Processing: Too complex for real-time embedded implementation

      } else if (spectral_centroid > 4000) {
          return 256;   // Smaller frames for high-pitched content
